I am writing to apply for the position of {} at {}. I am a computer science student with a strong background in {} looking to gain further experience in {}.

{} is of great interest to me due to my large background in algorithms. I have spent several years competing in competitive programming contests, in which one needs to find efficient solutions to mathematical algorithmic problems. I have achieved top ranks in many of these contests, and competing has led me to also look at real life problems with a mindset of efficiency. I believe this will help me in {} because {}.

Additionally, I have spent many years looking into the realm of cybersecurity particularly with a focus on binary exploitation, where one has to find low level memory exploits based on undefined program behavior. Besides increasing my awareness for security, the countless hours spent reading and analyzing library source code and memory structure has given me a better understanding on how applying heuristics and algorithms fit in the real world in performance sensitive operations. I intend to apply this knowledge to {}.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward for the opportunity to contribute to {}.
